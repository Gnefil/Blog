# BCI background

If you ever wondered the world of Brain-Computer Interface, we are in the same place. So interested I was in it, that I decided to prepare a year project related to BCI.  
In order to accomplish the proposed project, I had to do an extensive research on BCI. It was undoubtedly a time-consuming task,but also rewarding at the same time. The knowledge a I gained supported to build my own draft of an integral **framework of the BCI world**.  
I would really want to develop each of the points into proper paragraphs linking each logically. However, I decided to not disclose them fully until the full research is finished. So for now, I am presenting a series of words which are **concepts** that can help you to constitute **your own BCI mind map**. In case you need a further reading, I have also attached some further reading which were most helpful for me.

## Non-invasive vs Invasive
EEG preferred, 83% of BCI are EEG.

## Paradigms
Setups and target of study.

### First generation
- Sensorimotor rhythms
- P300
- Visual Evoked Potential
- Slow Cortical Potential
- Activity of Neural Cell


### Second expansion
Added:
- Response to mental task
- Hybrid

### The most studied paradigms now
- Motor Imagery
  - **Sensorimotor rhythms SMR**
  - Imagined Body Kinematics IBK
- External Stimulation
  - **P300**
  - **Steady State Visual Evoked Potential SSVEP**
- Error-potential
- Hybrid/others

## Mechanisms of Motor Imagery
- Mu rhythm and beta rhythms
- Normally brain in ERSynchronisation
- When trying to execute an action -> ERDesynchronisation
- Mainly in frontal and medial lobe
  - C3, C4 most relevant
- Capture these changes, identify patterns, predict actions

## Methodology in Motor Imagery
- Pipeline:
    1. Collect amplitude
    2. BCI Transducer
       1. Artifact Processor
       2. Feature Generator
          1. Signal enhancement / Feature pre-processing
          2. Feature extraction (paradigm dependent)
          3. Feature selection / Dimension reduction
       3. Feature Translator
          1. Feature classification
          2. Post-processing 
    3. Control Interface
    4. Device Controller
- A catalogue of methods (till 2007, review 1)
  - See Table 1 in Appendices
- A review 2 on methods till 2007
  - Feature filtering methods
    - Time domain
    - Spatial domain
  - Feature extraction methods
    - Band-power features
    - Time point features
    - Connective features
  - Feature selection
    - Filter
    - Wrapper
    - Embedded methods
  - Performance measurer
    - Classification accuracy
    - Confusion Matrix or Kappa metric
    - Receiver Operating Characteristics or Area Under the Curve
  - Classifiers: 5 families
    - Linear classifier
    - Neural Networks
    - Non-linear Bayesian classifiers
    - Nearest Neighbour classifiers
    - Combinations
- A review 3 up to 2018
  - Most frequent methods
    - Band-pass filtering
    - Common Spatial Patterns
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Review 2's update till 2017, future expectations, second generation methods
  - Adaptive classifiers
    - Preferred, outperforms, regardless supervised or not
  - Matrix and tensor classifiers
    - Promising, requires more research
    - Riemannian geometry classifier is at the state-of-art
  - Transfer learning methods
    - Useful when few data
    - Performance highly variable
  - Deep learning
    - Not convincing results
    - May due to limitation of data
    - Shallow CNN may work better
  - Miscellaneous but surprisingly good simple models when little data
    - Shrinkage LDA (always over LDA)
    - Random Forest classifiers



## Performance of Motor Imagery paradigms, a review
Importance of personal information + psychological + physiological + anatomical variables.
### Most frequent setup
- Number of channels
- Number of states
- Number of subjects
- ...
### Classification Accuracy
- Overall Corrected CA in the literature
- Correlations between setup variables and accuracy
- Few effective control

## BCI Challenges
### BCI Illiteracy is causing performance variation
Drives to ERD illiteracy. Difficult the transferability of a valid BCI. Inter-subject BCI is still difficult.

### Online vs Offline
Most of them are offline, while online is the important part.

### Advanced techniques still to be explored
Incorporate ANN, adaptive classifiers, Riemmanian Geometry Classifier, etc.

### Lack of standardised manner of summarising key features
Suggested a format of table of content.
